# CDP Public Cloud Trials

Welcome to CDP!

This guide helps you to navigate through CDP Public Cloud Trials.

CDP Public Cloud Trials is based on use cases that you use most often:

- [**Data Distribution with Data Flow**](https://github.com/cdp-trial-patterns/data-in-motion) - This trial outlines steps to implement streaming data ingestion use cases. It includes connecting to streaming data sources, perform in-stream routing, filtering and enrichment. Data is then delivered to diverse destinations such as Data Lakehouse powered by Apache Iceberg and Apache Kafka.
- [**All-In-One Open Data Lakehouse**](https://github.com/cdp-trial-patterns/opendatalakehouse) - This trial aims at providing a high-level overview of how to use the CDP Public Cloud service to quickly ingest data, explore raw data, create curated versions of the data for simple reporting and dashboarding, and then run a machine learning prediction use-case. It highlights the ease of use and automation capabilities that help ensure business objectives are met. You can explore different features of Iceberg.
